## Early thoughts

I guess this is the first official blog post. It will never go out. Employment prospects would cower in fear if this material got out. No, I'm just using this post to experiment with the capabilities of Hugo as a library. No doubt I'll produce a clean, tidy, nice version of this to help teach others about my experiences (especially with Hugo on WSL Ubuntu...), but, for now...

## Plans

Does anyone ever have a plan? Really? Predominantly there are a few articles that I would like to write about, regarding habits, people and things I want to complain about, the environment and the like, but in the grand scheme of things there is no prevailing architecture to this endeavour.

I would like to get better at writing as a creative pursuit, sure. Will a soapbox on which to stand to dole out my rubbish to the wider world be the means to that end? Why am I asking a computer screen questions? Who knows.

Watch this space.
