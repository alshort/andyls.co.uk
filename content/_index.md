title: "About Me"
---

A PhD research student at the University of Warwick as part of the 
High-Performance Systems Group, supervised by 
[Prof. Stephen Jarvis](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/stephen_jarvis/).

Prior to this, I received a BEng Computing degree (First Class Honours) from
Imperial College London, and an MSc Computer Science degree from the University of
Warwick, as well as doing 2 years in industry, mostly with 
[Lorax Compliance](https://www.loraxcompliance.com) as a Software Developer.

Writing and programming are my main passions. [My blog](/blog/) contains (read: will contain)
a lot of articles, technical and non-technical (viewed expressed in my blog are 
entirely my own). Write-ups of personal and publicly available projects are also
listed on my [projects page](/projects/).
