## What I'm Doing

At the moment, I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk), supervised by [Prof. Stephen Jarvis](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/stephen_jarvis/). I'm working in the area of High Performance Computing (HPC), specifically on optimising hydrodynamics code using just-in-time compilation techniques. The current aim of my project involves dynamically fusing and vectorising kernels together at runtime, using LLVM as the foundation of my work - notably the work by Hal Finkel et al on [ClangJIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08555).

## What I've Done

Before starting my PhD, I studied at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), getting a BEng Computing degree. After a few years in industry, I did my MSc Computer Science degree at Warwick, also.

During my time in industry, I worked at [Lorax Compliance Ltd](https://www.loraxcompliance.com/) in Rugby, UK as a Software Developer, working on internal infrastructure and automation tooling, as well as aiding in small part to the design and development of the latest version of their environmental compliance software.

## ...What About Outside of Work?

Reading is my main hobby. Mostly science fiction novels, but also history, classics, and popular science books (alongside the copious deluge of content that is in my RSS aggregator).

Occasionally, I like playing games on my Switch and PC, sometimes IRL also. Magic the Gathering, Factorio, and The Binding of Isaac are my all-time favourites and all games I highly recommend to anyone.

When not mandated by the government to stay indoors, running and going to the gym make it (*ahem* sparingly) on the list too.

Writing is a hobby I want to develop. Hopefully this website and blog aids in this endeavour - check out the posts I write [here](/posts).
